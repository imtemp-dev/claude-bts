# Implementation: final.md → Working Code

Implement the spec for recipe: $ARGUMENTS

## Prerequisites

1. Verify final.md exists:
   ```bash
   ls .bts/state/recipes/{id}/final.md
   ```
   If not found → "Run /recipe blueprint first."

2. Verify spec quality gate:
   - Check `verify-log.jsonl` exists and last entry has critical=0, major=0
   - If verify-log is missing or last entry has critical/major > 0 →
     "Spec not verified. Run /recipe blueprint to complete verification before implementing."
   - This prevents implementing from unverified or manually-created specs.

3. Check recipe phase:
   ```bash
   bts recipe status
   ```
   - If phase is "finalize" → fresh start, go to Step 1
   - If phase is "implement" → resume from tasks.json (Step 3)
   - If phase is "test" → skip to Step 5 (test already started, check results)
   - If phase is "sync" → skip to Step 6
   - If phase is "status" → skip to Step 7

## Resume Protocol

If tasks.json exists in the recipe directory:

1. **Stale check**: Compare tasks.json `updated_at` with final.md modification time.
   If final.md is newer → warn: "Spec changed since last implementation. Re-decompose? [y/n]"
   - If yes → go to Step 1 (fresh decomposition)
   - If no → resume below

2. **Task status recovery**: Read tasks.json and find resume point:
   - `in_progress` tasks → the last session was interrupted mid-task. Read the actual file
     to assess how much was written. Complete or rewrite as needed.
   - `pending` tasks → start from the first pending task
   - All `done`/`skipped` → skip to Step 4

3. **Retry count preservation**: Each task's `retry_count` persists across sessions.
   Resume from the saved count, not from 0. If a task has retry_count=4 and max is 5,
   it gets ONE more attempt before being blocked.

## Step 1: Task Decomposition

1. Read `.bts/state/recipes/{id}/final.md`
2. Extract file-level tasks: each file to create or modify becomes a task
3. Determine dependency order (shared types first, then modules, then integration)
4. Save task list to `.bts/state/recipes/{id}/tasks.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "recipe_id": "{id}",
     "started_at": "ISO8601",
     "updated_at": "ISO8601",
     "tasks": [
       {
         "id": "t-001",
         "file": "src/auth/types.ts",
         "action": "create",
         "status": "pending",
         "description": "Auth type definitions",
         "depends_on": [],
         "retry_count": 0,
         "last_error": ""
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

5. Update phase and log:
   ```bash
   bts recipe log {id} --phase implement --action implement --output tasks.json --based-on final.md --result "N tasks decomposed"
   ```

6. Validate:
   ```bash
   bts validate
   ```

## Step 2: Scaffolding

1. Create directories for all new files
2. Install dependencies if needed:
   - Node.js: `npm install` / `yarn add`
   - Go: `go mod tidy`
   - Python: `pip install` / `poetry add`
3. Create empty files or boilerplate as needed

**Environment check**: Run the build command once before writing any code.
If it fails with "command not found" or similar environment error → stop immediately
and report: "Build tool not available. Install [tool] before proceeding."
Do NOT proceed to task implementation if the build environment is broken.

## Step 3: Implementation Loop

**Reservations check**: If `.bts/state/recipes/{id}/reservations.md` exists,
read it before starting. When implementing a file listed in the "Affected Files"
section, warn: "[RESERVATION] This area has unresolved concerns from debate:
{concern}. Proceed with extra caution."

For each task in dependency order:

**Dependency check**: If a task's `depends_on` includes a blocked or skipped task,
auto-skip it with status `"skipped"` and last_error `"dependency blocked: {id}"`.

### ASSESS
- Read the task from tasks.json
- If status is `in_progress` → file may be partially written. Read the actual file
  and decide: complete the remaining parts, or rewrite from scratch.
- If status is `pending` → fresh start for this task
- Set status to `in_progress` and save tasks.json immediately

### IMPLEMENT
- Write the code exactly as specified in final.md
- Follow function signatures, types, error handling from the spec
- Preserve existing code when modifying files

### VERIFY
Run the project's build command:
```bash
# Detect and run appropriate build
# TypeScript: npx tsc --noEmit
# Go: go build ./...
# Rust: cargo check
# Python: python -m py_compile
```

**If build fails:**
1. Increment `retry_count` in tasks.json and save `last_error`
2. **Stagnation check**: Compare current error with `last_error`.
   If the error message is substantially the same as the previous attempt →
   try a fundamentally different approach (different algorithm, different API, etc.)
   Do NOT repeat the same fix.
3. Rebuild (check `retry_count` < 5)
4. If retry_count reaches 5 → mark task as `blocked`, save error, move to next task

**If build passes:**
- Update task status to `done`, clear `last_error`
- Update tasks.json `updated_at`
- Move to next task

### Log Each Task
```bash
bts recipe log {id} --action implement --result "task {task-id} done"
```

## Step 4: Checkpoint

Review task status:
- All `done` or `skipped` → continue to Step 5
- Any `blocked` → ask user:
  - "N task(s) blocked. Options:"
  - "[1] Skip blocked and continue (mark as skipped)"
  - "[2] Retry blocked tasks (reset retry_count to 0)"
  - "[3] Stop and review"
  - If [1] → mark blocked as `skipped`, continue
  - If [2] → reset retry_count, set status to `pending`, go back to Step 3
  - If [3] → stop and report details

> **Checkpoint**: Implementation tasks complete. Consider `/clear` before testing
> to free context for test generation. Work state is saved automatically.

## Step 5: Test

Check if test-results.json already exists with status `"pass"`:
- If yes → skip testing, go to Step 6

Update phase and run tests:
```bash
bts recipe log {id} --phase test
```

Use Skill("bts-test") with arguments: {id}

**If tests fail** (bts-test does not output `<bts>TESTS PASS</bts>`):
- Do NOT proceed to sync. Stop here.
- Report: "Tests failed. Fix implementation and re-run /implement {id} to retry from Step 5."
- The recipe stays in phase "test" for resume.

## Step 6: Sync

Check if deviation.md already exists:
- If yes → skip sync, go to Step 7

After tests pass, update phase and sync:
```bash
bts recipe log {id} --phase sync
```

Use Skill("bts-sync") with arguments: {id}

## Step 7: Status

After sync:
```bash
bts recipe log {id} --phase status
```

Use Skill("bts-status") with arguments: {id}

## Completion

When all steps are done:
- Verify tasks.json shows all tasks as `done` or `skipped`
- Verify no `blocked` tasks remain (all resolved or skipped)
- Output `<bts>IMPLEMENT DONE</bts>`

If unresolved blocked tasks remain:
- Report which tasks are blocked and why
- Ask user for guidance
